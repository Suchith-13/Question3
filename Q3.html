        <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior
            of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
        <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented
            by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen.
            Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <em>chemical equations.</em> 
            Here's an example of a <em>chemical reaction:</em></p>
           <p> 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O</p>
           <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas <em>(H₂)</em> and oxygen gas <em>(O₂)</em>
             to form water <em>(H₂O).</em></p>
        <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
        <p><strong>Stoichiometry</strong> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical 
            reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge 
            are conserved.
        </p>
        <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule,
             while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air
             we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
